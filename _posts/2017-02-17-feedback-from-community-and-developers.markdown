Well... This moment has come!
In the last couple of weeks we've gotten attention from research community 
related to semantic technologies as well as from developers.
<!-- more -->
We've received two inquiries about how to contribute to ontodia project.

Together with that we've fixed a couple of bugs that had to do with foreign 
objects in SVG incorrectly processed in browsers. The bugs were reported to us by users, 
which is extremely valuable to us.

We'd like to express our gratitude here to all who participated and 
continues to use our <a href="https://ontodia.org">ontodia.org</a> service or builds his solution around 
ontodia data visualization library <a href="https://github.com/ontodia-org/ontodia">github.com/ontodia-org/ontodia!</a> 

It's a pleasure to work with you and for you and it's amazingly rewarding to receive contributions and feedback!
In order to simplify for you the access to our development team and to our growing community, we'd like to invite 
you to join our Slack channel. Here's the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/mfKFRRNU9ToHxGGM2">form</a> to fill out, 
so we can add you to the list of members. On our slack channel you can get answers to your questions regarding 
the library and ontodia.org service directly from developers and other users.
