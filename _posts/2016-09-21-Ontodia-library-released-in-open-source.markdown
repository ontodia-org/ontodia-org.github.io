On September, 14 we published ontodia JavaScript library source code on <a href="https://github.com/ontodia-org/ontodia">github</a>. Since then we've been developing it openly on github thinking that we've got nothing to loose anyway. So by this blog post we invite you to use it, contribute to it and share your experience with it.
<!-- more -->

It was not an easy decision for us since we had to let go of something that we've been working on for the past 3-4 months. We had all sorts of concerns starting from commercial risks and ending with fear for exposing ourselves and our code. But we said yes to the opportunities that we foresee coming in the near future.

The library has already been integrated by a couple of platforms. First one is  <a href="http://www.intersystems.com/our-products/cache/cache-overview/">InterSystems Cache'</a>.
The story of integration is told (warning: in Russian only for now!) <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/intersystems/blog/310402/">here</a>.

The second one is still an ongoing process but the platform is <a href="http://metaphacts.com/product">metaphactory</a>. We are almost there now and the results of integration
will be demostrated at <a href="http://iswc2016.semanticweb.org/">ISWC 2016</a> in Kobe, Japan.

There's still so much to do and so many feature requests to fulfill, but we can feel that we're on the right track and thanks to all of you, who's supporting us with our advancements.

For more details about the source code and library capabilities please see github repository at: <a href="https://github.com/ontodia-org/ontodia">https://github.com/ontodia-org/ontodia</a>.
