## What it took to implement our ideas on ontodia platform

From day 1 we decided that one of our technical advantages will be the use of graph data under the hood and thus all 
the benefits which it brings. Why graphs? Well, our goal s to mash data from various sources to deliver the 
maximum awareness to the user. Let's say, you'd like to know the most about the particular company you are 
dealing with or planning to engage with. There are a number of state registries that publish relevant data, 
but it all comes in varios formats and hardly readable. Our offer is to combine them all together and present 
them in a form of a highly interactive and user-friendly web application.

"What?" question had very direct answer but the question "How?" was still on agenda. So we started looking around 
and realized that there are no so many tools out there that are capable of step-by-step navigation over data graphs 
combined with highly flexible visual templating mechanisms. When we accidentally came across ontodia we saught no 
further.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Search results page</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Ontodia - initial graph</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Expanding the graph in ontodia</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/img/blog/Searchresults.png" alt=""></td>
      <td style="border-left: 1px solid #384452; text-align: center"><img src="/assets/img/blog/ontodiafirststep.png" alt=""></td>
      <td style="border-left: 1px solid #384452; text-align: center"><img src="/assets/img/blog/ontodiasecondstep.png" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The other advantage that we greatly enjoy about ontodia is its ability to work over huge data sources. For instance 
only the registry of commercial entities contains over 10 mil records. Each record about company has approximately 
20-30 facts about it, which brings the total number of facts to 300 mil! And ontodia coupled with a decent tripple 
store can handle that with grace. The solution lies in incremental expansion of graph, which ontodia sets forth as 
the main usage scenario.

We had very strict requirements towards user interface. We employed one of the best specialsts in the area to do the 
mock up of UI and think through the user experience. Ontodia stood the test of pixel hunting quite well and managed to 
adjust to our initial images without any compromise on our side.
