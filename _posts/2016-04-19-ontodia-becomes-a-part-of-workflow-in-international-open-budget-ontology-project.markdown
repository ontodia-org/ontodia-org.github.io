Ontodia being by design a simple tool for visualization and exploration of ontologies has been adopted by 
British-Russian initiative challenged with collaborative development of open budget ontology. The 
developed top-level conceptual model will then be used as basic reference knowledge graph for bringing 
together all possible open data published on the web on finances and budgeting. In the close future with 
such ontology at hand, one could execute sophisticated analytics on governmentâ€™s spendings, monitor their 
dynamics and draw comparison conclusions.

## Distributed team problem solved - effective workflow

The problem that Ontodia helped overcome in the project was the remote nature of the team - 
all members live in different places and need to coordinate collaborative work. All 
communication about ontology development was based on diagrams produced and shared in Ontodia. 
The team extensively used its new feature - integration with GitHub and WebProtege. So the 
workflow was eventually quite simple:

1. Model things on paper or in sketches; 
2. Convert the sketches into fragments of ontology in offline Protege or WebProtege
3. Publish ontology on GitHub
4. Produce data view and diagrams in Ontodia; 
5. Discuss and make corrections

## Share problem solution with the world

Having a hands-on experience, it was not hard to put it on paper. The demo paper about the suggested 
workflow was submitted for one of the top conferences in semantic world - ESWC. The good news 
arrived just the last week - our demo is accepted!

See you on Crete at ESWC 2016!
